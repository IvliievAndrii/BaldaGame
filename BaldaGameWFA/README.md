# Game «Balda»

+«Balda» is the implementation of logic game with words.
+
+«Balda» is my first desktop game application, developed for demonstration purpose. It is available now on Windows. 

## Currently in development
 
+WinForms, Graph theory and Depth-first search algorithm were used while developing application.
+
+Project is under beta-testing now. The next goal is to allow user add letter and pick word with one mouse-click. 

## The rules of the game

+The game is played on a 5x5 grid, which is seeded by a random five-letter word. 
+
+Players have to take turn adding a single letter to an empty cell, placed in front of cell with letter (no diagonals).
+
The word must be read by moving along a chain of spaces which are horizontally or vertically connected, cannot use any letter twice and must involve the letter the player has added.
+
«Balda» is meant to be played using only the bare singular, nominative root nouns: without using any prefixes and suffixes for modifying root words.
